## Tips
Commands like `jira all`, `jira my-not-released` are implemented as [aliases](https://github.com/lusarz/jira-node-cli/blob/master/lib/aliases/my-stage.js). I'm planning to allow user to create his own aliases but currently there is a few hardcoded, so you may meet error like:

    JIRA respond with '400 Bad Request' status.
    ERROR MESSAGE:
    The value 'Released' does not exist for the field 'status'.
    Please try again later
                                                                                                                                                           	
As a workaround please use plain `jira jql` queries, for example:
    
    jira jql 'project=ABC AND status in (New)'
    jira jql 'assignee in (currentUser()) ORDER BY status ASC' 
    jira jql 'project=XYZ AND assignee in (currentUser()) ORDER BY status ASC'                                                                                                                                                       	.
